Document Summary Assistant - Technical Approach

Architecture Overview

The Document Summary Assistant is built as a modern single-page application using React and TypeScript, focusing on modularity and user experience. Here's a breakdown of the key technical decisions and implementation details:

Core Technologies
- React + TypeScript: For type-safe component development and better maintainability
- Vite: Modern build tool for faster development and optimized production builds
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- Tesseract.js: Client-side OCR processing for image documents

Key Implementation Details

1. Document Processing Pipeline
   - Implemented a unified processing flow for both PDFs and images
   - Used FileReader API for text extraction from PDFs
   - Integrated Tesseract.js for OCR processing of image files
   - Handled file validation and processing states for better UX

2. Component Architecture
   - Modular components with clear separation of concerns
   - Shared types and interfaces for type safety
   - State management using React hooks for simplicity
   - Responsive design patterns for mobile compatibility

3. User Experience
   - Drag-and-drop file upload using react-dropzone
   - Clear loading states and error handling
   - Intuitive summary length controls
   - Clean, accessible interface with Lucide icons

The application prioritizes client-side processing where possible, with room for future integration of server-side AI services for enhanced summary generation.
